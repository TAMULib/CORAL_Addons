**************************
These Add-ons are meant to be installed by someone who is familiar with CORAL and the database backend.  An automated installer is NOT included with these Add-ons.  A detailed description for a manual install is included in the README file for each Add-on.


This Add-on will display a list of Licenses / Resources that have been modified during the timeframe specified in the configuration file. In order to track all the changes a TRIGGER is added to the tables in the database.  Because of this not all modifications will appear from the beginning but over time it will become more complete.


More information in the readme_updates.txt
